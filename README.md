# Android-Application-for-Recycling
This is an android application designed for a school project that lists recyclable items and where they can be recycled in Corvallis, OR.
The first page of the app contains links to the republic recycling depot and a guide to what items the republic takes. Upon entering the app, the user is given a list of categories of recyclable items. After selecting a category, a list of subcategories appears. The user can then select a subcategory, and the app will provide a list of businesses that will take these items. At this point, the user can click on a map to view the businesses, or they can click on a business to find out more information about it.
The code contained here is just a sample of the code for the android application. Other parts of this project included a website for administrative purposes, a MySQL database to hold the data, and an API that allowed the android app to perform GETs and the web app to perform GETs, POSTs, PUTs, and DELETEs to obtain and modify the data in the database.
